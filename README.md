# Reports337

ABOUT: These are the 9 reports I created in Fall 2016 for MTH337. Each report contains a small, independent project. All reports were created using Jupyter Notebook. Updated versions of the reports were created with Spyder4 and python 3.7, and may expand upon the original subject material in the original reports. Updated reports are mainly code-only; for more detailed explainations of the projects see the corresponding Jupyter Notebooks.

Project topics include:
- Report 1: Primitive Pythagorean Triples
- Report 2: Prime Spiral
- Report 3: Mauna Loa Carbon Dioxide Levels
- Report 4: Floating Point Numbers
- Report 5: Cellular Automata
- Report 6: Magnetic Pendulum
- Report 7: Bouncing Ping Pong Ball
- Report 9: GPS
- Report 10: Statistical Language Models



Other Notes:
- Report 3 requires the NOAA ESRL mean monthly Mauna Loa CO2 data 
- Report 5: cellular automata will change each time the code is re-run
- Report 7 requires a sound file
- Report 10 requires the text files of either The Phantom of the Opera, Hamlet, Pride and Prejudice, or The Count of Monte Cristo which can be obtained through Project Gutenberg

The file 337Fall2016_Reports is just a compliation of all reports into one notebook.
